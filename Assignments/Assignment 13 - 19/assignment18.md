#1.	g(a) = (1,2)

	g(b) = (1,3)

	g(c) = (2,3)

#2.	a) Yes the graph is simple because there are no parallel looping sides

	b) No, the graph is not complete because you cannot connect any node with ever other node

	c) Yes the graph is connected because you can get to a node from any other node using a path

	d) Yes there are two paths from 3 to 6 ([3->4->5->6], [3->5->6])

	e) Yes there are cycles in the graph (ex. [3->4->5->3])

	f) Yes, if you remove a5, there are no more cycles

	g) Yes you can remove a few arcs to make the graph not connected (ex. a2, a6)

#5.	See Drawings for Assignment 18 folder...

	a)	This is implying that the IT department does not know anybody from the marketing department and vice versa if it is an unconnected graph

	b)	Carl and Fletcher do not know each other in the acquaintanceship graph. SiuYin is acquainted with only one person (Carl)

	c)	The degree of separation between Carl and Yuri is 2

#13.	

	(b) is not isomorphic to the others because it does not contain an isolated node with a degree of 0

#30.	

	It divides the plane into 8 different regions

#49.	

	The graph consists of n disconnected nodes with a loop at each node because the matrix only consists of 1s going down the diagonal which means every node is only connected to itself

#50.	

	The graph consists of no connections and only isolated vertices since the matrix is all 0s

#51.	

	All nodes in the graph are connected which means the matrix only has 0s going down the diagonal with 1s everywhere else

	The matrix for G' will have 1s where A had 0s and 0s where A had 1s except for diagonal elements, which remain 0s
