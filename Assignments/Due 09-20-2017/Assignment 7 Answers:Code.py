### 1.

	n = 25, 100, 169

	n()

### 2.

	x, y

	x = 2n + 1

	y = 2m + 1

	x + y <=> (2n + 1) + (2m + 1)

			   2m + 2n + 2

			   2(m + n + 1)

	z = (m + n + 1)
			   
			   2z

	2z = defintion of equal numbers

### 3.

	x, y

	x = 2n

	y = x^2

Prove x + y = even

	2n + (2n)^2 = even

	2n + 4n^2 = even

	2(n + 2n^2) = even

	z = (n + 2n^2)

	2z = definition of equal numbers

### 4.

	n = 2k + 1

	(2k + 1)(2k + 1) = even

	4k^2 + 4k + 1 = even

	2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1 = even

	2z + 1 = even = contradiction

	Proved by contradiction
