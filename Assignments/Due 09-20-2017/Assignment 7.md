  - Write a program (in a language of your choice) that does the following:
    - [X]  Prove:  If n = 25, 100, or 169, then n is a perfect square and is the sum of two perfect squares.  Indicate which method of proof you used.
    - [X]  Prove:  The sum of two odd integers is even.  Hint: By definition, even integers can be expressed as 2n, thus odd integers can be expressed as 2n + 1
